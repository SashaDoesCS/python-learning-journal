# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

My name is Sasha (he/him), and I'm currently a sophomore in high school. I took the intro to Python class at WVC over the summer, and before that I've had some experience with programming in Java and html/CSS, though I only learned the basics of programming from it. I have previous experience in Cybersecurity having taken a course, as well as getting 2 certifications on the subject, a certification in Networking and the CCST by Cisco. On the side I also like to play chess, make music, and pixel art.
