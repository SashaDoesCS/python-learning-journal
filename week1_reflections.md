Well it has only been 2 classes, we havent exactly gone much into the actual content of the course, however the pace difference due to being able to use ai is interesting,
I haven't had any classes before that directly allow the use of ai let alone encourage it, which is something interesting to see, as I believe for areas like programming and
data it is something that will greatly benefit people wanting to make their own projects and learn at a quicker pace, since there is less worrying about syntax and more focus
on how it works. We also had a little exercise in using ai which I'll add, where there was a task to use ai to create something related to pokemon. 
The class before this that was required, the intro to Python, taught all the essentials for the language, everything from variable naming to making functions, objects, functionality of
get requests and everything inbetween. Most of my knowledge on Python comes from that course and I think it gave me a solid foundation of all the basics.
